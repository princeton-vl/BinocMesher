# BinocMesher
We propose a temporally coherent method for extracting meshes suitable for long-range camera trajectories in unbounded scenes represented by an occupancy function. The key idea is to perform 4D mesh extraction using a new spacetime tree structure called the binary-octree, from which 3D meshes are sliced.

Code coming soon.
